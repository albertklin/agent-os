# Server Configuration
PORT=3011

# Database
DB_PATH=./agent-os.db

# Network Security
# The server REQUIRES Tailscale for secure remote access.
# It binds to all interfaces but uses IP filtering to only accept connections from:
# - localhost (127.0.0.1) - for non-containerized session hooks
# - Docker bridge network (172.16.0.0/12) - for containerized session hooks
# - Tailscale CGNAT range (100.64.0.0/10) - for remote web UI access
# If Tailscale is not running, the server will refuse to start.
